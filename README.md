# Spectrometer
Using Xilinx RFSoC 4x2 board, we designed a spectrometer with 400 and 800 Mhz bandwidth (BW).\\
We used a Keysight Analog signal generator, with varying frequencies up to BW. \\
We can see the strong signal at the input signal and harmonics on the integral multiple of signals. In Continuous wave harmonics are common. Of course, harmonics should be less than the applied frequencies.
